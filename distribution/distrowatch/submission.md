# DistroWatch — new distribution submission (draft)

Submit via the DistroWatch "Submit a distribution" page once the ISO is publicly
downloadable (SourceForge). DistroWatch only lists distros with a public release and
a working download, and reviews submissions manually — so do SourceForge first.

## Description (≈ 100 words)

SkillFishOS is a steampunk-themed gaming Linux distribution built specifically for the
AMD BC-250 — a salvaged, low-cost mining board carrying a semi-custom Zen 2 + RDNA 2 APU
(16 GB GDDR6). Based on Debian sid with KDE Plasma 6, it ships a custom linux-tkg kernel
that unlocks all 40 Compute Units, a dedicated SMU governor, CPU/GPU overclock and undervolt
profiles with thermal protection, Btrfs snapshots with one-click rollback, a full gaming and
emulation stack (Steam, EmuDeck, ES-DE, Heroic) and an on-device Vulkan AI stack. The system
boots in English with language selection at install. Open source; a generic x86-64 version is
planned.

## Notes for the editor
- Release: **26.06 "Aetherium"** (BC-250 specific).
- The project is not affiliated with AMD or any console manufacturer.
