description: The most common BC-250 problems and how SkillFishOs handles them.

Many of the BC-250's "problems" are actually known hardware flaws that SkillFishOs works around automatically. Here are the most common ones.

## The screen stays black / the monitor isn't detected

The DisplayPort **Hot-Plug Detect (HPD) is broken**: the board doesn't detect when you connect a monitor. SkillFishOs handles this with the `skillfish-dp-hotswap` daemon (which forces detection at boot and on monitor changes) and the `video=DP-1:e` kernel parameter.

What to check:

- use a **DisplayPort monitor** or a **passive** DP→HDMI adapter;
- avoid **active** DP→HDMI adapters: besides detection issues, they **break the audio** (see below);
- if the monitor changed, wait a few seconds: detection is automatic but not instant.

## The board won't wake from standby

Suspend is **broken at the hardware level**. SkillFishOs disables it completely for this very reason (see [Desktop](/en/docs/desktop)). If the board appears "dead" after being idle and power management had been changed, the only way out is a **physical reset**. Do not re-enable sleep states.

## No audio from the monitor/TV

DisplayPort audio works, but:

- **active DP→HDMI adapters** break the audio: use passive adapters, a native DP monitor, a **USB DAC** or **Bluetooth** audio;
- the audio stack is **PipeWire**: the default sink is set from KDE's audio settings.

## The controllers don't work

- **DualShock 4** controllers go over **Bluetooth** (with gyroscope). To pair: hold *Share + PS* until they blink, then pair from the Bluetooth GUI.
- A controller **over USB** must be connected with a **data** cable (not just charging): it's recognized as an Xbox 360.
- Clone controllers may not share the Bluetooth adapter well with the DS4s: in that case use them **over USB**.

## The GPU seems slow / temperatures are high

- Check in the [Tuner](/en/docs/app-native) that the **40 CUs** and the SMU governor are active.
- Remember the cooling is marginal: after prolonged load the **thermal-guard** (85 °C) kicks in. For valid benchmarks, let the board cool between runs (see [GPU](/en/docs/gpu-overclock)).
- For **CPU-bound** games, lowering the resolution won't raise the FPS.

## An update broke something

Reboot and from the **GRUB → "SkillFishOs snapshots"** menu pick a working previous snapshot. See [Storage and snapshots](/en/docs/storage-snapshot). Pre/post-update snapshots are automatic.

## The AI won't start or gives strange output

- The AI runs on Vulkan (not ROCm) and **shouldn't be used together with games** (same GPU/RAM).
- If the output is corrupted, make sure you're using the KV cache in **f16** (`q4_0` corrupts the output on RADV). See [On-device AI](/en/docs/ai-locale).
