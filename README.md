# SkillFishOS

**A dark, steampunk, gaming-focused Linux distribution that turns the AMD BC-250 compute board into a daily-drivable desktop and games console — tuned and ready out of the box.**

[**skillfishos.com**](https://skillfishos.com) · Based on Debian · KDE Plasma · GPL-3.0

**Release 26.06 "Aetherium"** — three editions: **BC-250**, **Generic x86-64** (PCs & VMs) and **Slim** (BC-250, ultra-lean) · boots in English, language chosen at install

SkillFishOS takes the cheap, abundant **AMD BC-250** compute board — a semi-custom APU from the **AMD Zen 2 + RDNA 2** family (CPU codename *Oberon*, GPU *Cyan Skillfish* / `GFX1013`, 16 GB GDDR6) — and makes it a proper Linux machine: a steampunk KDE Plasma desktop on one side, a Steam Big-Picture / EmuDeck games console on the other, with all of the board's awkward hardware **tamed and tuned for you**.

> It began as a way to get kids to **use and learn Linux while they game** — gaming is the carrot, Btrfs snapshots are the safety net that lets them tinker without fear.

**The whole point: a ready-to-use system, no tinkering required.** Every governor, kernel patch, overclock profile, thermal guard and driver workaround is already configured and tested — you turn it on and it runs at full speed. Everything is documented here so the community can understand it, reproduce it, and make it better.

> 🤝 **This is a community open-source project and we want it to grow.** Contributions of every kind are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Hardware target

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | AMD BC-250 (*Cyan Skillfish*, `GFX1013`) |
| CPU | AMD Zen 2 (*Oberon*), 6 cores active — OC to **3.9 GHz** (Turbo), **4.0 GHz** validated |
| GPU | RDNA 2, 24 CUs default → **40 CUs unlockable** |
| Memory | 16 GB GDDR6 (shared / UMA) |
| Base distro | Debian **sid** |

The BC-250 is fantastic value but a difficult target: non-standard clock control through the SMU, a broken display IRQ/HPD path, an unreliable RDSEED, locked-down compute units, no IOMMU and BIOS ACPI gaps. SkillFishOS papers over all of it. See **[docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md](docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md)** for the full list and how each problem is solved.

## Highlights

- 🐧 **Custom `linux-tkg` kernel** `7.0.11-skillfishos` — BORE scheduler, GCC `-O3`, 1000 Hz, NTsync + fsync, with BC-250 patches: GPU clock range unlocked **350–2230 MHz**, **40-CU unlock** (opt-in), and the cosmetic *"RDSEED is not reliable…"* boot spam silenced. Built in **three flavours**: **main** (`-march=znver2`, BC-250), **generic** (`-march=x86-64`, PCs/VMs) and **slim** (BC-250-only, lean module set). Prebuilt `.deb` in [**Releases**](../../releases/tag/kernel-7.0.11-skillfishos) or `apt install skillfishos-kernel` — see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
- ⚡ **Real clock control** — the `cyan-skillfish-governor` drives the GPU to its safe-point and idles it at 350 MHz; an SMU **CPU overclock & undervolt** reaches **4.0 GHz** (validated) under an 85 °C thermal guard. **~11,330 GFLOPS** fp32 with the 40-CU unlock (≈1.8× a stock build). The ISO ships the safe **Stock** profile; users opt into more from the Tuner.
- 🎛️ **SkillFishOS Tuner** — a native **PyQt6** app to overclock & undervolt CPU and GPU, control the fan, resize the UMA VRAM split, and manage **Compute Units live** — a grid of CU squares (green = on, red = off, 24/32/40 presets, **no reboot**) with a **CU health test** for the silicon lottery. Four ready presets (Stock · Performance · Turbo · Crazy), *benchmark-and-rollback* testing, and a pop-up **live monitor** (temperature / frequency / voltage / fan charts) during any test. Bilingual **IT/EN**. No terminal needed.
- ⚙️ **Live Compute Units** — boots at the 24-CU driver baseline and routes up to **40 CUs at runtime** (via `umr`, no kernel param), restored at boot by a systemd service. Toggle/test from the Tuner or `skillfish-cu`.
- 📊 **Live system HUD** — a translucent overlay with per-core CPU load, clocks, temps, power draw, VRAM/RAM, **active CUs**, fan RPM and Bluetooth controller battery, all from real sensors.
- 📸 **Btrfs + Snapper + grub-btrfs** — automatic pre/post-apt snapshots and bootable rollbacks straight from the GRUB menu, with `@home` kept separate so a rollback never touches user data.
- 🎮 **Gaming, ready** — Steam, Heroic, Proton, gamescope (+ FSR 1), GameMode, MangoHud, plus **EmuDeck** and the **ES-DE** frontend to install and configure emulators in a few clicks. *(SkillFishOS ships the tools, not the games — you bring your own games and ROMs.)*
- 🧠 **On-device AI** — an Ollama + OpenWebUI stack accelerated in **Vulkan** on the integrated GPU, with a one-click panel that frees the GPU when you want to play.
- 🧩 **Native PyQt6 app suite** — grouped under a dedicated **"SkillFishOS"** menu: **Tuner**, **AI Panel**, **Monitor** (live sensor charts), **Kernel Manager** (pick the boot kernel and uninstall old ones), **ISO Mount**, and **Hub** — a Discover-style software centre: browse by category, search, read app pages with screenshots, and install/remove/update across **APT** (incl. the signed [`aetherium`](https://mtsistemi.github.io/SkillFishOS/) repo), **Flatpak** and **Snap**, plus add/remove software sources. Every app ships as an updatable `.deb`.
- 🎨 **End-to-end steampunk theme** — GRUB, Plymouth, SDDM, the KDE Plasma desktop, icons, cursors, Kvantum and wallpaper. The theme lives in [`theme/`](theme/).
- 🖨️ Driverless printing (CUPS + IPP Everywhere + Avahi), Bluetooth controllers, broken-HPD display hot-swap, and a fully localized desktop.

Full per-benchmark detail — every setting, clock, voltage, temperature and power reading — is on the **[Performance & benchmarks page →](https://skillfishos.com/docs/prestazioni/)**

### Synthetic compute — `vkpeak` fp32-scalar (GFLOPS)

| Configuration | GFLOPS | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Stock ~2000 MHz, 24 CU | 6141 | baseline |
| tkg + governor, 24 CU | 6868 | +12 % |
| **tkg + governor + 40-CU unlock** | **11329** | **≈1.84× baseline** (≈11.3 TFLOPS) |

Also: FP16 vec4 **22 685**, int8 dot-product **45 495 GIOPS**, memory bandwidth **~350–367 GB/s** (clpeak).

**Same hardware, +34 % just by changing OS** — Superposition 1080p Extreme: SkillFishOS **5513** vs another distro at stock clocks **4102**. In gaming the BC-250 lands in **Radeon RX 6600/6600 XT** territory.

CPU OC validated up to **4.0 GHz** (~1224 mV, 120 s stress, 83 °C peak) on the reference board; under combined CPU+GPU load the APU shares its power budget gracefully, easing CPU clocks to stay within the 85 °C limit.

## Get it

### Prebuilt kernel

Prebuilt kernel `.deb`s (three flavours) are published under [**Releases**](../../releases/tag/kernel-7.0.11-skillfishos):

```sh
# main BC-250 kernel (znver2)
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-7.0.11-skillfishos_7.0.11-1_amd64.deb
# …or generic (PCs/VMs): linux-image-7.0.11-skillfishos-generic_7.0.11-1_amd64.deb
# …or slim (lean, BC-250): linux-image-7.0.11-skillfishos-slim_7.0.11-2_amd64.deb
```

Or, from the signed APT repo, simply `sudo apt install skillfishos-kernel` (a thin wrapper that fetches the full kernel `.deb` from the GitHub Release). To build it yourself, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) and [`kernel-build/`](kernel-build/).

### Installable ISOs — **26.06 "Aetherium"** (three editions)

Each live ISO (~6.2 GB) is captured from the real system with [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs): KDE Plasma steampunk desktop, Btrfs + Snapper + grub-btrfs, the native PyQt6 app suite, the signed `aetherium` APT repo, and the **Calamares** installer. They **boot in English** and let you pick your **language and keyboard** at install; the bilingual apps and HUD follow the chosen locale.

| Edition | Kernel | For |
|---|---|---|
| [**BC-250**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/files/26.06-Aetherium/SkillFishOS-26.06-Aetherium-BC250-amd64.iso/download) | `7.0.11-skillfishos` (znver2) | the AMD BC-250 board |
| [**Generic**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/files/26.06-Aetherium/SkillFishOS-26.06-Aetherium-Generic-amd64.iso/download) | `7.0.11-skillfishos-generic` | any x86-64 PC / VM |
| [**Slim**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/files/26.06-Aetherium/SkillFishOS-26.06-Aetherium-Slim-BC250-amd64.iso/download) | `7.0.11-skillfishos-slim` | BC-250, ultra-lean |

Downloads are hosted on **SourceForge**: [sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/files/26.06-Aetherium](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/files/26.06-Aetherium/) (the project also hosts the code mirror, blog, forum and wiki). The publishing flow (SourceForge Files, the **`aetherium`** APT update repository, and the DistroWatch submission) is documented under [`distribution/`](distribution/).

> The signed **APT repo is live** at <https://mtsistemi.github.io/SkillFishOS/>. After install, the **Hub** app (or `apt`) keeps the kernel and every native app up to date from it.
