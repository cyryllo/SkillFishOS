# SkillFishOS

**A dark, steampunk, gaming‑focused Linux distribution that turns the AMD BC‑250 compute board into a daily‑drivable desktop and games console — tuned and ready out of the box.**

[**skillfishos.com**](https://skillfishos.com) · Based on Debian · KDE Plasma · GPL‑3.0

**Release 26.06 "Aetherium"** — BC‑250 edition · boots in English, language chosen at install · a generic x86‑64 build will follow

SkillFishOS takes the cheap, abundant **AMD BC‑250** compute board — a semi‑custom APU from the **AMD Zen 2 + RDNA 2** family (CPU codename *Oberon*, GPU *Cyan Skillfish* / `GFX1013`, 16 GB GDDR6) — and makes it a proper Linux machine: a steampunk KDE Plasma desktop on one side, a Steam Big‑Picture / EmuDeck games console on the other, with all of the board's awkward hardware **tamed and tuned for you**.

> It began as a way to get kids to **use and learn Linux while they game** — gaming is the carrot, Btrfs snapshots are the safety net that lets them tinker without fear.

**The whole point: a ready‑to‑use system, no tinkering required.** Every governor, kernel patch, overclock profile, thermal guard and driver workaround is already configured and tested — you turn it on and it runs at full speed. Everything is documented here so the community can understand it, reproduce it, and make it better.

> 🤝 **This is a community open‑source project and we want it to grow.** Contributions of every kind are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Hardware target

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | AMD BC‑250 (*Cyan Skillfish*, `GFX1013`) |
| CPU | AMD Zen 2 (*Oberon*), 6 cores active — OC to **3.9 GHz** (Turbo), **4.0 GHz** validated |
| GPU | RDNA 2, 24 CUs default → **40 CUs unlockable** |
| Memory | 16 GB GDDR6 (shared / UMA) |
| Base distro | Debian **sid** |

The BC‑250 is fantastic value but a difficult target: non‑standard clock control through the SMU, a broken display IRQ/HPD path, an unreliable RDSEED, locked‑down compute units, no IOMMU and BIOS ACPI gaps. SkillFishOS papers over all of it. See **[docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md](docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md)** for the full list and how each problem is solved.

## Highlights

- 🐧 **Custom `linux-tkg` kernel** `7.0.10-skillfishos` — BORE scheduler, GCC `-O3`, `-march=znver2`, 1000 Hz, NTsync + fsync, with BC‑250 patches: GPU clock range unlocked **350–2230 MHz**, **40‑CU unlock** (opt‑in), and the cosmetic *"RDSEED is not reliable…"* boot spam silenced. Prebuilt `.deb` in [**Releases**](../../releases) — see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
- ⚡ **Real clock control** — the `cyan-skillfish-governor` drives the GPU to its safe‑point and idles it at 350 MHz; an SMU **CPU overclock & undervolt** reaches **4.0 GHz** (validated) under an 85 °C thermal guard. **~11,330 GFLOPS** fp32 with the 40‑CU unlock (≈1.8× a stock build). The ISO ships the safe **Stock** profile; users opt into more from the Tuner.
- 🎛️ **SkillFishOS Tuner** — a native **PyQt6** app to overclock & undervolt CPU and GPU, control the fan, resize the UMA VRAM split, and toggle the 40‑CU unlock, with **four ready presets** (Stock · Performance · Turbo · Crazy) and built‑in *benchmark‑and‑rollback* testing. Bilingual **IT/EN**. No terminal needed.
- 📊 **Live system HUD** — a translucent overlay with per‑core CPU load, clocks, temps, power draw, VRAM/RAM, fan RPM and Bluetooth controller battery, all from real sensors.
- 📸 **Btrfs + Snapper + grub‑btrfs** — automatic pre/post‑apt snapshots and bootable rollbacks straight from the GRUB menu, with `@home` kept separate so a rollback never touches user data.
- 🎮 **Gaming, ready** — Steam, Heroic, Proton, gamescope (+ FSR 1), GameMode, MangoHud, plus **EmuDeck** and the **ES‑DE** frontend to install and configure emulators in a few clicks. *(SkillFishOS ships the tools, not the games — you bring your own games and ROMs.)*
- 🧠 **On‑device AI** — an Ollama + OpenWebUI stack accelerated in **Vulkan** on the integrated GPU, with a one‑click panel that frees the GPU when you want to play.
- 🎨 **End‑to‑end steampunk theme** — GRUB, Plymouth, SDDM, the KDE Plasma desktop, icons, cursors, Kvantum and wallpaper. The theme lives in [`theme/`](theme/).
- 🖨️ Driverless printing (CUPS + IPP Everywhere + Avahi), Bluetooth controllers, broken‑HPD display hot‑swap, and a fully localized desktop.

## Performance

`vkpeak` fp32‑scalar throughput (GFLOPS):

| Configuration | GFLOPS | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Stock ~2000 MHz, 24 CU | 6141 | baseline |
| tkg + governor, 24 CU | 6868 | +12 % |
| **tkg + governor + 40‑CU unlock** | **11329** | **≈1.84× baseline** |

CPU OC validated up to **4.0 GHz** (~1224 mV, 120 s stress, 83 °C peak) on the reference board; under combined CPU+GPU load the APU shares its power budget gracefully, easing CPU clocks to stay within the 85 °C limit. Full methodology and benchmarks: [docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md](docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md).

## Get it

### Prebuilt kernel

A prebuilt kernel `.deb` is published under [**Releases**](../../releases/tag/kernel-7.0.10-skillfishos):

```sh
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-7.0.10-skillfishos_7.0.10-1_amd64.deb \
            linux-headers-7.0.10-skillfishos_7.0.10-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-mark hold linux-image-7.0.10-skillfishos linux-headers-7.0.10-skillfishos
```

To build it yourself, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) and [`kernel-build/`](kernel-build/).

### Installable ISO — **26.06 "Aetherium"**

The installable live ISO (`SkillFishOS-26.06-Aetherium-BC250-amd64.iso`, ~5.6 GB) is captured from the real system with [penguins‑eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs): KDE Plasma steampunk desktop, Btrfs + Snapper + grub‑btrfs, the **Calamares** installer. It **boots in English** and lets you pick your **language and keyboard** at install; the bilingual apps and HUD follow the chosen locale.

The project is on **SourceForge** too: [sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skillfishos/) (code mirror, blog, forum, wiki). The publishing flow (ISO hosting on SourceForge Files, the **`aetherium`** APT update repository, and the DistroWatch submission) is documented under [`distribution/`](distribution/).

> The signed **APT repo is live** at <https://mtsistemi.github.io/SkillFishOS/> (`apt install skillfishos-kernel`). The ISO download link goes live with the SourceForge Files upload — track progress on [skillfishos.com](https://skillfishos.com).
