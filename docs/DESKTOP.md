# Desktop & theme

SkillFishOS runs **KDE Plasma 6** with a complete **SkillFish Steampunk** theme. It's mature, fully GUI‑configurable (network, Bluetooth, displays, wallpaper, right‑click menus — all native), and Qt‑native so the Kvantum theme applies cleanly.

## Sessions

SDDM (auto‑login, themed) offers:

- **KDE Plasma (X11)** — the default, because remote access (x11vnc) is trivial on X11.
- **KDE Plasma (Wayland)** — selectable.
- **Gaming (gamescope)** — a Steam Big‑Picture console session, independent of the desktop. See [GAMING.md](GAMING.md).

> Earlier builds used Wayfire and Hyprland; both were removed in favour of KDE, which solves the rough edges (empty network/BT panels, no wallpaper GUI, no desktop context menu) natively. The full brass theme was ported to KDE.

## The SkillFish Steampunk theme

A coherent brass/steampunk look across the entire boot‑to‑desktop chain — accent `#d8a849` on dark brown:

- **GRUB** theme, **Plymouth** boot splash, **SDDM** login (custom QML), and a fish‑themed wallpaper.
- **Plasma**: a global look‑and‑feel package (`org.skillfish.steampunk`), color scheme, desktop theme, **Kvantum** Qt style, **SkillFishSteampunk** icon theme (with symbolic icons that recolor to the scheme), **SkillFish‑Steampunk‑Cursors**, and a brass Konsole palette.
- The **Kickoff** application menu uses the brass fish logo.

The theme is shipped in this repo under [`theme/`](../theme/) — see [theme/README.md](../theme/README.md) for install notes (including the cursor‑symlink gotcha).

> ⚠️ The icon theme must provide `inode-directory` (not just `folder`) or KDE shows generic folders in the base theme's blue — SkillFishOS copies `folder.svg` → `inode-directory.svg` to fix this.

## Live system HUD

A translucent, always‑on overlay (top‑right) built with **Conky** on the X11 session, styled to match the brass theme. It shows:

- Per‑core CPU mini‑bars, average CPU clock & temperature, package power draw.
- GPU clock, temperature, VRAM usage.
- RAM and disk usage, fan RPM.
- **Connected Bluetooth controllers grouped by category** (Gamepad / Audio / …) with **battery %** read from UPower.

Sensor reads go through a small helper that locates hwmon devices **by name** (k10temp / amdgpu / nct6686), so it survives the hwmon index shuffling across boots.

## SkillFishOS Tuner

A native **GTK4 / libadwaita** app (themed brass) to control the hardware with no terminal:

- **CPU** overclock/undervolt (via the SMU OC tool).
- **GPU** safe‑point (rewrites the governor config).
- **Fan** control (nct6686 PWM).
- **UMA VRAM** split (BIOS CMOS — reboot to apply).
- **40‑CU unlock** toggle (cmdline — reboot to apply).
- Per‑slider steppers, inline help, and **Test = apply → benchmark → verify/rollback** (CPU via sysbench, GPU via vkpeak) so a bad setting reverts itself.

A polkit policy lets the active local user run the privileged helper (a personal machine — no password prompts for the kids).

## Local AI panel

A matching brass GTK4 panel to turn the on‑device LLM stack on and off with one click — it frees the GPU/RAM when you want to game. See [AI.md](AI.md).

## Other niceties

- Driverless printing (CUPS + IPP Everywhere + cups‑browsed + Avahi); the user is in `lpadmin`.
- Fully localized desktop (ships IT/EN).
- A "Software" store (Discover with deb + flatpak backends).
